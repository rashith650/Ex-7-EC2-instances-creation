# Ex-04 EC2 Instance Creation

## *Aim*
To set up and launch an Amazon EC2 instance, providing on-demand computing services with flexible configurations for application deployment.

## *Objectives*
1. *Log into AWS*: Access the AWS Management Console to create and manage resources.
2. *Launch EC2 Instance*: Configure the required instance parameters, including OS, storage, instance type, and network settings.
3. *Create Key Pair*: Generate a secure SSH key pair for EC2 access.
4. *Configure Network*: Adjust the instanceâ€™s VPC, subnets, and security groups as needed.
5. *Connect to Instance*: Use SSH to establish a connection to the EC2 instance.
6. *Automate EC2 Instance Creation*: Set up an Ansible playbook to automate the instance setup.
7. *Monitor Instance State*: Track instance states (running, stopped, terminated) and utilize AWS CloudWatch for performance monitoring.
